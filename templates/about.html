    <h1>About Phishing URL Detector</h1>
    <p>
      The Phishing URL Detector is an intelligent tool designed to identify malicious websites that aim to steal sensitive information from users.
      It utilizes a combination of URL-based features, content analysis, domain statistics, and machine learning models to determine whether a given URL is legitimate or a phishing attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our system evaluates URLs based on live status, page content, domain age, similarity to known websites, and many more features.
      It is built using Python, Flask, and machine learning techniques like Stacking Ensemble with models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is aimed at raising awareness and enhancing web safety for users by providing a quick and reliable phishing detection service.
